# todo

-   Rooms:
    -   Add / Edit
    -   Alter light state inside group
-   Lights:
    -   Add / Edit
    -   Alter color
-   About content
-   ALL: responsive styling > mobile

# ideas

-   Save references to lights into the group state so groups are automatically updated when lights are turned off by other groups.
-   Split the displayed lights in lightList into a seperate component and use watchers to alter the state.
-   DISCO MODE!!!

# bugs

-   sidebar not keeping to the correct size (since change from position fixed?)
